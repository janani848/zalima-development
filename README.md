E-commerce Fraud Detection System
Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Data Science and Machine Learning internship. The objective was to build a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent e-commerce transactions based on user behavior and transaction patterns. The final model achieved a high accuracy of 97%, offering a robust solution for real-time fraud prevention.

Objective
The goal is to develop a fraud detection system using supervised machine learning techniques that:

Accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate

Identify behavioral patterns commonly associated with fraud

Support e-commerce platforms in reducing financial losses and improving transaction security

Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle

Size: 10,000+ e-commerce transactions

Target Variable: fraud (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

Key Features:

user_id, purchase_value, payment_method, device_type, browser, session_time

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

Platform: Kaggle Notebooks

Version Control: GitHub

Model Used: Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV for optimization

Implementation Summary
Data Preprocessing
Verified and cleaned data for missing values and outliers

Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Normalized numerical features using MinMaxScaler

Model Training
Logistic Regression selected for its interpretability and performance

80/20 train-test split with 5-fold cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 97%

Precision: 96%

Recall: 98%

F1-Score: 97%

Key Insights
All fraudulent transactions occurred with the combination: PayPal + Desktop + Safari

Average fraud transaction value was $342 compared to $102 for legitimate transactions

Fraudulent sessions lasted around 20 minutes, while legitimate ones averaged 8 minutes

100% of frauds occurred on desktop devices; mobile and tablet showed no fraud cases

Business Impact
High fraud detection rate with minimal false positives

Risk scoring system can flag high-risk transactions in real-time

Potential to significantly reduce chargebacks and financial losses

Improved customer experience with minimal disruption to legitimate users

Future Improvements
Include additional features such as geolocation, IP reputation, and device fingerprinting

Experiment with ensemble methods and deep learning models

Deploy real-time fraud detection using streaming data pipelines

Develop adaptive models that evolve with changing fraud tactics

Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with end-to-end machine learning workflows

In-depth understanding of fraud detection challenges and business impact

Improved skills in data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation

Ability to translate technical insights into business-oriented strategies
